# Statistics Project 1

## Overview
This repository contains a statistics project that covers tasks such as implementing counting measures, interval measures, exponential distribution calculations, and using integration for probability measures.

## Skills Used
- Counting Measures
- Interval Measures
- Exponential Distribution (Exp(Î»))
- Integration for Probability Measures

## Contents
1. **Counting Measure:**
   - Implemented in Python to satisfy additivity on disjoint sets.

2. **Interval Measure:**
   - Python class to define intervals and compute their length measures.

3. **Exponential Distribution:**
   - Defined a function to calculate the probability mass using the exponential distribution's CDF.
   - Tested on various intervals and plotted the PDF.

4. **Integration for Probability Measures:**
   - Defined a function to compute integrals of the exponential distribution's PDF.
   - Compared results with previous CDF calculations.

## Usage
To run the analyses and visualizations, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can execute the provided code snippets in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment.

## File
- `Statistics-Project-1.pdf`: Contains all the code and analyses used in this project.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the analysis or additional queries, please create a pull request or open an issue.
